# Experiment Protocol

## Experiment Aim
To assess the efficacy of RNALater as a fixative for automatically sampling and in-situ fixing bacterial community RNA and DNA present in the coastal waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.

## Sampling Scheme
The research center receives flowing seawater through a dedicated pumping system. For this experiment, a reservoir is filled by this system with 200L of coastal seawater. Seawater samples are automatically extracted, filtered, and fixed using the "McLane Phytoplankton and Particle Sampler" (PPS). The PPS automatically fixes samples by supplying excess fixative to the filter holder, flooding the filter until the planned retrieval.

The McLane Phytoplankton and Particle Sampler (PPS) will automatically collect 23 seawater samples (1000 ml/sample, 125 ml/min) from the 200L reservoir over a total of 330 minutes (15 min/sample). Each sample will be filtered and stored on a separate filter holder within the PPS. All filters will be immediately fixed after filtration with RNALater except for controls (see table). All filters, including the controls, will remain inside the PPS during the experiment until the programmed retrieval to test for the efficacy of the in-situ sample conservation over time.

## Retrieval Scheme
This experiment uses a timed retrieval schedule to determine how extracted RNA and DNA quality changes as samples are fixed with RNALater inside the McLane sampler and exposed to environmental conditions for short and long periods. The experiment will also investigate any changes that might occur in the populations of microbes in the water samples during the filtering process.

Control samples will be collected (filtered but not fixed) through the sampling round. These control samples will account for natural variations in microbial community composition over time and, unlike the other samples, the control filters won't be treated with fixative before or after filtration. Instead, they will be retrieved immediately after collection and analyzed.

The remaining samples treated with RNALater will be collected at specific time points to monitor RNA and DNA preservation over time and will be collected in triplicate on days 1, 3, and 14 following the sampling round. There will be an exception: only two replicates of the fixed sample on day 14. This exception accounts for a total of 23 samples including the control groups, which is the maximum filter-holding capacity of the PPS.

The fixed and control sample timing is designed to capture variations in the microbial communities, control and fixed samples are taken in an intercalated manner: the fixed sample is taken following the control sample. See the graph of a possible variation scenario where the retrieval time is color-coded: pink, blue, green, and yellow for days 0,1,3 and 14 respectively:

## Optional Environmental Monitoring
Monitor changes in environmental conditions within the sample round period (CTD, pH, Nutrients).

## Sample Analysis
Preserved samples will be tested for RNA and DNA quality using Agilent TapeStation and potentially sequenced to identify bacterial diversity.

## PPS Automatic Fixation Description
McLane's PPS consists of a set of 23 in-line polypropylene filter holders outfitted with 47 mm diameter Whatman GF/F glass microfiber filters with 0.7-micrometer particle retention. The filter holder's outlet support screen rests on a modified base that also serves as a cap for a 20 mL fixative reservoir. The modified base has a 1/4-inch centered outlet for the filtrate and two eccentric 0.5 mm holes that allow fixative in the reservoir to disperse into the filter holder. To completely fix samples, prior to sample filtration, the filter holders are primed with fixative; following filtration, the additional fixative is pumped into the filter holder, forcing the remaining sample through the filter and flooding the filter holders with fixative. The additional pumped fixative contributes to keeping the filter in contact with the adequate concentration of fixative given that during the filtration of the samples, the fixative could disperse out of the reservoir into the filter holder and wash out with the filtrate.

## RNALater Needed
According to the sampling scheme, there will be 11 filter holders that will be primed with fixative, plus additional fixative will be pumped to ensure fixations inside the filter holders after filtering. This accounts for 20 ml per filter holder, plus an additional 25 mL for priming each filter and 25 mL for post-filtering fixing plus and additions 2 mL for preserving the 23 filters in cryovials:
$$\text{RNALater volume} = 11 \text{ filters} \times (20+25+25) \text{ ml/filter} + 2 \text{ml/filter}\times23\text{filters} = 816 \text{ mL}$$
Therefore, at least 900 milliliters of RNALater must be prepared to account for losses and storage of samples, taking into account a 10% safety factor.

## Priming Procedure
### Preparation
Based on: [PPS manual by Mclane](https://mclanelabs.com/pps-manual/)
#### Custom Adaptors
To Prevent the mix of RNALater with Double Distilled Water (DDW) and maintain sterile conditions during priming, build custom hose-luer lock adaptors, and connect them to the input and output of the 25-way valve.

#### Disinfection
- Disinfect lines and the custom-build adaptor before the priming procedure by running NaClO %5 through the lines. 

- Disconnect the filter holders from the PPS, disassemble and disinfect all parts, wash, let dry, reassemble, and reconnect back to the PPS.


### Filter Holder Disconnection and Line Flushing
#### Disconnection
- Disconnect the filter holders from the base.
#### Flushing
- Flush the filter holder's water-up and water-down lines with DDW to clean the 25 multi-port valves.

### Reservoir Filling
#### DDW Reservoirs
- Number of filter holders: 12
- Fill these reservoirs with 20 mL of DDW.


#### RNALater Reservoirs
- Number of filter holders: 11
- Fill these reservoirs with 20 mL of RNALater.


### Priming with RNALater
#### Priming with RNALater
- Inject the RNALater from the water-down line of the filter holder (the 25-way valve output).
- Ensure the water-down line of the filter holder is free of air.


#### Reservoir Cap Installation
- Install the reservoir cap.

#### Lower Support Screen Installation

- On top of the reservoir cap, install the lower support screen.


#### Filter Installation
- Install the filter into the filter holder.

#### Upper Support Screen Installation
- Install the upper filter support screen, sandwiching the filter between the lower and upper support screens.
#### Line Filling
-Inject the RNALater into the filter holder until the water-up line is filled.

#### Valve Isolation
- Move the 25-way valve to the next port, isolating both lines and leaving the filter primed with RNALater, ready for filtration.

### Priming with DDW
- Follow the same procedure as above, substituting RNALater with DDW.
