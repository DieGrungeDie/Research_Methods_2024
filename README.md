The Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) is a region of significant environmental vulnerability due to its strategic importance in global oil transportation, which heightens the risk of oil spills. Traditional methods of monitoring the environmental impact of such contamination are limited in scope and sensitivity. 
This research proposes utilizing metatranscriptomics to identify biomarkers of oil pollution within seawater bacterial communities in the EMS. By employing an innovative in-situ diffusion chamber culturing device (CCS) coupled with an automated sampler (PPS), this study aims to overcome the constraints of laboratory settings and provide a more accurate representation of natural conditions. The research will focus on the metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial communities exposed to both anthropogenic (oil spills) and natural (dissolved organic matter) contaminants. 
Preliminary studies have shown the potential of metatranscriptomics in identifying differential gene expression related to oil degradation. This study's outcomes will contribute to more effective environmental monitoring and pollution management strategies, advancing our understanding of microbial responses to contaminants and improving the protection of marine ecosystems.
